  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>    
  <p> 
Consider that you have been given a set of latitude/longitude co-ordinates for various cities (represented as points) on a map along with their respective population size. Can you write an efficient function to find the city that most closely represents the population center for all the given cities? Take a sample data set with at least 10 data points. Each data point has City name, Latitude, Longitude, and Population size.
Please write your code in any object-oriented programming language and make sure it compiles and runs well. Send me the instructions to run the program on command line in a linux environment. Please make sure the code is well commented and readable. Also, follow all the standard coding practices in the language you choose.
Along with your program, please also mention the run-time complexity of your core solution and any assumptions that you have made
</p>
<h3> Approach </h3>
  <p> The Apporach is  based on input from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_population">Wiki</a></p>
<h3> Solution</h3>
    
   <p> <Strong>Input </Strong>: Input is obtained by calling a GET on resftul api : http://localhost:8080/api/COP/Cities <br>
   This returns the data about cities latitude and longitude . This input read from the file : <h6>input_cities.json </h6>
    Google Map JavaScript Api's are use to plot this input on the map. </p>
    
   <p> After the input is plotted,  Press the  <Strong>Center of Population</Strong> button. This would invoke restful api http://localhost:8080/api/COP/COP which calculates the Mean Center of all the data points using the formula as indicated below :</p>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="assets/img/mean_center_formula.png" class="img-responsive"/>
          <br>
       </div>
      <p> This api would return Center Value (Latitude and Longitude) for give set of data points.
          This data would be overlayed on the map to display <Strong>Center Of Population .</Strong> along 
          with the nearest city.</p>. Click on the marker to see more details about the nearest city and the
          distance from the COP.
    
      <h3>The Deep Dive </h3>
    
      <p> The solution is being done  using  MVC Pattern . </p>
       <ul>
       <li>View : is this current page which uses  restful api for getting the data </li>
       <li>Controller: server.js on which provides restful apis acts as the controllers to bring in data for the view.</li>
       <li>Model : in the current use example, <b>it is input_cities.json</b></li>
      </ul>
    
        <h4>API's</h4>
            <p>There are 2 apis's that are being used in this application </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
                <b> http://localhost:8080/api/COP/cities </b> <br>
                 This returns all the cities that are being considered for calculations.
            </li> 
             <li>
                 <b> http://localhost:8080/api/COP/COP </b> <br>
                  This returns all nearest city and Mean Center for given set of cities and there population.
                  <i> Currently , this api is overloaded and can be cleaned up further</i>
             </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Interesting Algorithm's</h4>
             There are 2 Algorithms that are interesting in this application
        <ul>
        <li> The First is finding center of population. This requires to find the weight of each input and then use that weight to get the mean. 
        Time Complexity O(n).
        </li> 
         <li> The second algorithm is finding nearest city from the mean co-ordinate. This requires to find the distance b/w  2 co-ordinates and get the least out of it.  Again , Time Complexity O(n).
        </li>
        </ul>
